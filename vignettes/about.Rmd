## On-Going Development Projects

The core focus of the Zelig team in the near future is on a series of releases 
that:

- Substantially improve Zelig's [robustness and stability through the development 
of an extensive test suite](https://medium.com/zelig-dev/testing-zelig-b41961cbfab8#.1cfq1andn)

- [Improve Zelig's documentation](https://medium.com/zelig-dev/documenting-zelig-31e7d2f6c11b#.e5n398uu4)

- Expand what Zelig can do with simulations, including returning them to users in
standardised data frames and possibly converting graphing functions to 
[ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/).

- Improve Zelig functionality for small samples, namely diagnostics via jackknife
variance estimator

- Implement Cox Proportional Hazard models

- Implement two-stage least squares regression (instrumental variable regression).

- Enhance time series models

- Introduce Functionality for research on privacy protected data

- Increase <a href="https://iqss.github.io/rpackagemetrics/">adoption <i class="fa fa-line-chart" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and build a user 
community

These are on-going projects related to Zelig, which will be released 
periodically as part as related Zelig packages, outside Zelig core:

- Hierarchical models: A new Zelig related package for multilevel models

- Ecological Inference models: [A new Zelig related package](https://github.com/IQSS/ZeligEI)

- GAM: A new Zelig related package

- Improved replication utilities for Zelig results

**Zelig (noun) /ˈzɛlɪɡ/** : An entity with chameleon like characteristics, able to change appearance and form to fit appropriately in any circumstance.

Leonard Zelig was born in Brooklyn, New York at the turn of the century into a Jewish immigrant family. He gained notoriety and celebrity status during the 1920s due to his supernatural ability to look and act like whomever was around him. F. Scott Fitzgerald penned in his memoirs of meeting Leonard Zellman, a charming and impeccably dressed aristocrat, at an affluent garden party in Long Island. Lou Zelig turned up soon after at the New York Yankees spring training camp in Florida. Later, he was seen as a member of Al Capone’s Cosa Nostra and a black jazz musician in Chicago. Leonard inspired Woody Allen’s 1983 fictionalized documentary film, Zelig, about this "chameleon man"" who changed his appearance and persona to comfortably blend into his surroundings and integrate himself into important historical events. Similarly, Zelig: Everyone's Statistical Software is intended to fit in every situation, and to work for every model and approach.
