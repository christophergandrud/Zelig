The core focus of the Zelig team in the near future is on a series of releases
that:

- Substantially improve Zelig's [robustness and stability through the development
of an extensive test suite](https://medium.com/zelig-dev/testing-zelig-b41961cbfab8#.1cfq1andn)

- [Improve Zelig's documentation](https://medium.com/zelig-dev/documenting-zelig-31e7d2f6c11b#.e5n398uu4)

- Expand what Zelig can do with simulations, including returning them to users in
standardised data frames and possibly converting graphing functions to
[ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/).

- Improve Zelig integration with [Amelia](http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia), 
[MatchIt](http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/matchit-nonparametric-preprocessing-parametric-causal-inference), 
and [WhatIf](http://gking.harvard.edu/whatif) packages

- Improve Zelig functionality for small samples, namely diagnostics via jackknife
variance estimator

- Implement Cox Proportional Hazard models

- Implement two-stage least squares regression (instrumental variable regression).

- Enhance time series models

- Introduce Functionality for research on privacy protected data

- Increase <a href="https://iqss.github.io/rpackagemetrics/">adoption <i class="fa fa-line-chart" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and build a user
community

These are on-going projects related to Zelig, which will be released
periodically as part as related Zelig packages, outside Zelig core:

- Hierarchical models: A new Zelig related package for multilevel models

- Ecological Inference models: [A new Zelig related package](https://github.com/IQSS/ZeligEI)

- GAM: A new Zelig related package

- Improved replication utilities for Zelig results
